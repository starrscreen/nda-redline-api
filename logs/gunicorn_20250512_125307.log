Confidential information also includes the name of any business or individual who wishes it not be known that they are in discussions with the Parties to explore the possibility of an acquisition.\n\nb.\tConfidential Information does not include information:\ni.\twhich at the time of disclosure is in the public domain and generally known;\nii.\twhich the recipient can show by written records was already in its possession and not subject to an existing agreement of confidentiality between the Parties;\niii.\twhich is independently developed by the recipient as evidenced by its written records;\niv.\twhich is received from a third party, other than a current or former Representative of the disclosing Party, lawfully, without restriction and without breach of this Agreement or any other agreement; or\nv.\twhich is disclosed pursuant to a valid order of a court, regulatory agency or other governmental body; provided, however, that the recipient shall first have given notice to the disclosing Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Confidential Information be used only for the purposes for which the order was issued and not be further disclosed.\n\nPROTECTION OF WORK AND INFORMATION: \n \nEach Party agrees not to disclose and to take all reasonable steps as may be necessary (including, but not limited to, all steps it customarily takes to protect the confidentiality of its own most confidential information) to protect as confidential any Confidential Information.  Confidential Information shall be disclosed only to those employees, representatives, agents and affiliates and prospective buyers, sellers and/or investors (the “Representatives”) of the Parties who have a need to know such information in connection with the Business Purpose.  Each Party shall advise its respective Representatives that the Confidential Information is and shall be treated as confidential and that by receiving such information such Representatives are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement and not to use such information for any purpose other than described in this Agreement.  Each Party shall be responsible for any improper use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives.\nEach Party shall not use any information relating to the Confidential Information other than in relation to the Business Purpose, or at any time copy information relating to the Confidential Information, except as necessary to further the Business Purpose.\nAll communications with Target shall be directed through Advisor unless otherwise authorized in writing by Advisor.

Neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party or its Representatives resulting from any inaccuracy in nor the incomplete nature of Confidential Information supplied under this Agreement.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF MATERIALS:  \n\nUpon written request, the requested Party shall destroy all Confidential Information disclosed to it or its Representatives under this Agreement, in whatever form contained, and whether original or copies, including all notes, memoranda or things created or prepared by the requested Party or its Representatives and containing, based upon, derived from or otherwise reflecting any such Confidential Information, but excluding a single list for historical purposes which identifies the documents and things which were destroyed,  without disclosing the Confidential Information contained in them.  To the extent that any Confidential Information is subject to SEC Rule 17a-4, such information will not be destroyed and will be stored in a confidential manner as described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties and their Representatives shall (i) be permitted to retain copies of the Confidential Information to the extent required to comply with applicable law or regulatory authority or written and established internal document retention policies and (ii) not be required to destroy, delete, or modify any backup tapes or other media pursuant to automated archival processes in our ordinary course of business, provided in each case (i) and (ii) herein, any such Confidential Information retained shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this agreement for so long as such Confidential Information is retained.\nAny information relating to the Confidential Information that is not destroyed, including, without limitation, any oral information, shall remain confidential, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nThis is the entire Agreement between the Parties with respect to the use and non-disclosure of the Confidential Information and replaces and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements between the Parties with respect to such use and non-disclosure.\nThere are no representations or covenants, express or implied, other than those set forth in this Agreement.\nThis Agreement may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both of the Parties.\nNothing contained in this Agreement shall create a joint venture or partnership between the Parties.\nUnless and until a written definitive agreement concerning a business relationship in connection with the Business Purpose has been duly executed, neither Party will have any obligation to the other with respect to any such business relationship whether by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Business Purpose or otherwise.\nAll Confidential Information disclosed by a Party to the other shall be and shall remain the disclosing Party’s property and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a license from either Party to make, use, license, sell, or copy any inventions, ideas, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrightable works, or other property of the other Party, whether or not disclosed under this Agreement.\nIn the event that the Parties do not proceed with any future business relationships in connection with the Business Purpose, each Party specifically covenants not to disclose voluntarily the existence or nature of the discussions between them.\nAdvisor is executing this Agreement on behalf of Target for the purpose of keeping the identity of Target confidential.

Any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void.\nDuring the term of this Agreement the Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\nEach Party understands and agrees that, a breach or threatened breach by the other Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable injury that is not adequately compensable in money damages.  In the event of such breach or threatened breach, each Party may be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach.  This Agreement shall be construed and governed by and under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any consideration as to jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.  \nIf any provision of this Agreement is not enforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.  \nThis Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes, and together shall constitute one and the same document.  Telecopied signatures shall be relied on as original signatures in all respects.\nThe obligations of the Parties hereunder will terminate two (2) years from the date hereof.\n\nEach of the Parties indicates its acceptance of the terms of this Agreement by the signature below of a duly authorized representative.\n\n\n________________________________\t\t\t   \tPSMJ Resources, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn behalf of Target\n\n\nSignature:________________________\t\t\t\tSignature:____________________________\t\t\t\nBy:    ______________________\t\t\t\tBy:    Karl Wohler\n\nTitle: ______________________\t\t\t\tTitle:  Senior M&A Advisor\t\n\nDate:                    \t      \t\t\t\t\tDate:    \t\t\t\t\t\n\nKarl Wohler\nSenior M&A Lead Advisor\nPSMJ\xa0|\xa0Resources, Inc.\n10 Midland Avenue\nNewton, MA 02458\nCell: 508-341-1370\nkwohler@psmj.com \nwww.psmj.com\t\n        \n        Please analyze the NDA and suggest changes.
